        Define a public HotelBooking class, which will contain the following fields that must be accessible outside of this class:
        GuestName (string)
        StartDate and EndDate (DateTimes)
        The constructor of this class should take the following parameters (please maintain the given order and names):
        guestName (string)
        startDate (DateTime)
        lengthOfStayInDays (int)
        The constructor should set all fields of this class.
        The EndDate should be calculated in the constructor as the StartDate plus the lengthOfStayInDays . You can use the AddDays 
        method from the DateTime type to calculate it. You can do it right in the constructor body.
